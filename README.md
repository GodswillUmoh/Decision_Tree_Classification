# Decision_Tree_Classification
> Decision Tree Classification is a popular supervised learning technique used in machine learning. It splits data into branches based on certain conditions, leading to decisions or predictions at the leaf nodes. Each internal node represents a feature (attribute), each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome.
